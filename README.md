# Wharton_Municode
A repository built off of [Andrej Karpathy's nanoGPT] (https://github.com/karpathy/nanoGPT): a smaller scale version of ChatGPT able to run on your personal computer. 

This repository is part of a project at the University of Pennsylvania aiming to adopt large language models - such as ChatGPT - for use in the legal space. It aims to lay foundational work for future implementation in this area. 

Wharton_Municode is designed, as the name suggests, to accept municipal codes as input. Input text to train the nanoGPT model was taken from [municode](https://library.municode.com/), a library containing over 3300 municipal codes for towns across the country. Below are beginner-friendly instructions for setting up and training the model on your own device.
