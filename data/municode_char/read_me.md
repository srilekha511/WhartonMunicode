# Municode

Run prepare.py to output the number of training and validation tokens. The number of tokens outputted depends on the size of the municipal code file. This municode_char prepare.py file will output a different number of training and validation tokens from the municode prepare_py file. This is because the data is being tokenized on a character level.
